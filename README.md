# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

Model to help identify segments from credit card customer data. To employ PCA analysis and KNN modelling to group data and determine key factors that differentiate segments.

## Data cleaning
- Conducted analyses to understand the dataset and clean it, handling outliers, dropping redundant features and stanardising it in the process.
- Applied PCA to group rows and identify key groupings that could help guide segment identification.

## Modelling
Applied KNN clustering regression and analysed resulting feature space to discern descriptors for identified segments.

## Plotting 
Took bi-variate approach to plotting data in order to determine which two factors discriminated well between all the segments.
